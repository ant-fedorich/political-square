        All liberals come from the belief that upholding freedoms
        personality is more important than meeting the needs of society.
        Left-wing liberals tend to believe that a person cannot use his freedoms without a certain level
        education and material comfort. In their opinion, this makes redistribution between
        rich and poor. On the contrary, Right-wing Liberals tend to believe that taxing a person against
        his will to provide social benefits to others is an act of violence and thus violates
        individual freedom. They support charity and help for the poor, provided that they are voluntary.

        All supporters of a more authoritarian type of government come from
        that the welfare of society is above the desires of specific individuals.
        Right-wing authoritarianists hold so-called paternalistic political views.
        They defend a hierarchical society and take a tough stance against threats,
        - The criminals are in prison, and foreign states are held back by strong defense.

        Maximum freedom of the economy and the individual. Maximum personality autonomy.
        Libertarians believe that a person has full rights (sovereignty) to his body,
        own life and property obtained as a result of her own efforts or voluntary exchange.
        \n
        \nWhat libertarians want to undo:
        \n\t• Taxes (or at least drastically reduce the amount and reduce the remaining, because,
        from their point of view, this is legalized robbery by the state).
        \n\t• Conscription.
        \n\t• Punishment for crimes without a victim
                (e.g. drug use, prostitution, arms smuggling, driving in a seat belt).
        \n\t• Antitrust bans.
        \nWhat libertarians want to legitimize.
        \n\t• Same-sex marriage.
        \n\t• Free carrying weapons.
        \n\t• Euthanasia.
        \nWhat libertarians argue about.
        \n\t• Legalization of all types of immigration.
        \n\t• Abortion - part of the libertarians believe that from an early period of development,
                the fetus has the same rights,
                as a born person; their opponents believe the abortion ban violates the mother’s right to choose.
        \n\t• Age of sexual consent - some libertarians believe that it should be abolished altogether,
            since it is introduced arbitrarily by the authorities and, accordingly, can be considered violent.
        \n\t• Deprivation of rights due to incapacitation - some libertarians believe that this is also an “attack”
            on personal autonomy.
        \n\t• International politics - some libertarians reject the right of countries to intervene; another thinks
                that they are possible if basic human rights are systematically violated somewhere.
        \nThey advocate the so-called minimum state, or a state that acts as a “night watchman”.
        Its functions should be reduced to ensuring national defense, law and order and judicial procedures.
        \nUnlike libertarianism, supporters of anarchism against any hierarchies and power,

        (closer to anarcho-communism)
        \n
        \nIn socialism, the state largely controls the economy and means
        production, and its goal proclaims equality and fair distribution of goods.
        \n
        \nBut libertarian socialists advocate the abolition of private property
        on the means of production and the state as an unnecessary and harmful institution.
        They are anti-capitalists and opponents of a market economy. In the end
        most Marxists agree with this, but for libertarian socialists
        anti-authoritarianism and anti-parliamentarism.
